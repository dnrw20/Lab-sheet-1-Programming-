#Lab-sheet-1-Programming-

#EX.1 
Write a function(s) that finds, and prints, whether a number
is even or odd and/or prime. For example, given the number 11 we would
expect to be printed odd and prime.

#EX.2
Write a function(s) that calculates, and prints, the distance
between two points. For example, if the points were (0, 0) and (3, 4),
we would expect to see 5.00 printed.

#EX.3
Write a function(s) that finds, and prints, the remainder after
division of one number by another (i.e. the modulo or % of a number) using
iteration. Do not use any C library functions or the % operator.

#EX.4
Write a function that finds, and prints, the remainder after
division of one number by another (i.e. the modulo or % of a number) using
recursion. Do not use any C library functions or the % operator.

#EX.5
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is
3025 - 385 = 2640
Write a function(s) which finds, and prints, the difference between the sum
of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of
the sum.
